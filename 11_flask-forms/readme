DISCO:


QCC:
Where does it say "Submit Query" in app.py or index.html (HTML thing) Why does it show  SUbmit query?


Predictions:
What is

The print statements will output to the terminal, not the website 

The html code will look like:
Welcome (big)
Enter (less big)
username: (Area to input text)
sub1 (Buttom to submit answer)

<form action="/auth">
      <input type="text" name="username">
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">
</form>

The print statements will print:
app -> "__main__"
request -> ?
request.args -> ?
request.headers -> ?

Outcomes:

***DIAG: this Flask obj ***
<Flask 'app'>
***DIAG: request obj ***
<Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' [GET]>
***DIAG: request.args ***

To be done in 20 minuntes:
Put method = thing after parameter afrgument inside the function call
Set method to GET, POST and see what happens
